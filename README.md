# Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs

This repository contains the code used for the paper ['Blind Dates: Examining the Expression of Temporality in Historical Photographs`](link). The study experiments with the task of 'dating' historical photographs using OpenCLIP, aiming to extend our understanding of the visual representation of time and its influence on image interpretation.

The notebooks are adapted for Google Colab.

## Data

The experiments use the [De Boer Scene Detection dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/7137452), a collection of 52,160 digitized historical press photographs from 1945-2005. We focus on a subset of the dataset made up of images for which dates were available, and limited to the period 1950-1999.

Place the dataset in `./data/images`.
